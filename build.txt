1 each plugin has pipfile python server start works

audio -works  , does it download ?
 sample input in audio-transcription\audio\sample.mp3 

facematch -works  , needs deepface weights in userprofile\.deepface\weights and .matplotlib
	
	inputs : FaceMatch\resources\sample_images
        search : test_image.jpg in FaceMatch\resources

deepfake image works , needs retinaface weights in userprofile\.deepface\weights

            binary_deepfake_detection\pretrained and weights --needs files downloaded

	    image_model\binary_deepfake_detection\images\*.png for demo

deepfake video needs weights\xception-b5690688.pth downloaded

               videos\inputs\*.mp4 and videos\outputs for demo

eg

middle_checkpoint.pth.tar in image_model\binary_deepfake_detection\pretrained
dffd_M_unfrozen.ckpt in image_model\binary_deepfake_detection\weights
